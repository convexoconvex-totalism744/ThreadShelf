# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) working in this
repository. Humans should read this too — it is the short, accurate map of the
project. `CLAUDE.md` simply points here so Claude Code picks up the same rules.

## What this project is

**ThreadShelf** — a local, offline semantic-search and backup tool for AI chat
exports (Google AI Studio, OpenRouter, OpenAI/ChatGPT, Anthropic/Claude, LM Studio,
Grok/xAI). It
parses exported JSON into normalized turns, chunks and embeds them locally
(Xenova/Transformers.js), stores vectors in LanceDB, and exposes search through a
React web UI, an HTTP API, and an MCP stdio server.

Parsing, embeddings, storage, and search run on the user's machine. **By default,
no chat data leaves the device.** The embedding model may be downloaded on first use.
Treat all real chat exports as private.

The optional conversation-generation layer is **Experimental Alpha**. Its
primary `llama.cpp` engine is local and loopback-only. OpenRouter is an explicit,
opt-in external exception: picking the OpenRouter provider tab sends selected
user/assistant thread content, the optional master prompt, and the new prompt
off-device; archived thinking is excluded. There is no longer a per-send consent
checkbox — the `off-device` chip on the model button and the composer hint carry
that signal. New chats are saved locally by default in the protected
`threadshelf_conversations` collection and semantic index. The explicit
ghost-icon private mode is tab-scoped and never persisted.

The **master prompt** is a small collection of user-written system prompts. They
are hand-written and expected to last, so they are stored server-side in
`.threadshelf/master-prompts.json` (`src/generation/master-prompts.ts`, atomic
write, mode 0600, `MASTER_PROMPTS_PATH` override) and served by the loopback-only
`/api/generation/prompts` CRUD routes. The client holds no copy beyond the
react-query cache (`['master-prompts']`). The active prompt is sent as
`systemPrompt` on every generation request and prepended as a leading `system`
message; it is never persisted into a stored thread, so re-reading a chat never
replays a prompt the user has since changed.

The repo is an **npm workspaces** monorepo: the root and `client/` share a single
`package-lock.json` and a hoisted `node_modules/`. A plain `npm install` at the
root installs both.

**Before opening a PR / finishing a task, run `npm run check`.** If you only
touched the parser/ingest/search, `npm test && npm run test:e2e` is the minimum.

## Conventions

- **Language/runtime:** TypeScript, ESM (`"type": "module"`), Node 20.19+. Server
  code runs directly through `tsx` — there is no separate server build step.
- **Imports:** use `.js` extensions in relative imports (ESM + tsx requirement),
  e.g. `import { Turn } from './validation.js'`.
- **Style:** Prettier + ESLint are the source of truth. Run `npm run format`
  rather than hand-formatting. Match the surrounding functional style in `src/`
  (small pure functions, `readonly` types, no classes for parsing logic).
- **UI type scale:** small labels use the `--fs-micro` (11px) / `--fs-meta`
  (11.5px) tokens from `_tokens.scss` — do not hand-pick sizes below them. The
  UI is dense with mono metadata, and anything smaller stops being readable.
  Titles wrap and also carry the full value in a `title` attribute; only
  secondary metadata may ellipsise, and it must keep the `title` attribute too.
- **Narrow-screen text:** wrapping text that can contain unbreakable tokens
  (URLs, long file names) uses `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, **not** `break-word` —
  only `anywhere` lowers the intrinsic min-content width, so `break-word` still
  lets one long token widen its container. Grid rows that hold such text use
  `minmax(0, 1fr)` tracks; a bare `1fr` cannot shrink below min-content and the
  content escapes the card. `test/playwright/result-title.spec.js` guards both.
- **No new runtime dependencies** without a clear reason — a goal of the project
  is to stay light and fully local. Never add anything that phones home.

## Data model (mental model)

```
JSON export -> parser (detectProvider) -> normalized Turn[]
            -> chunking -> local embeddings -> LanceDB collection
            -> UI / HTTP API / MCP search

stored thread -> generation registry -> llama.cpp (local) OR OpenRouter (external, explicit consent)
                                      -> provider SSE -> NDJSON progress/token stream -> UI
```

- A **Turn** is one of `{ user }`, `{ thinking }`, or `{ ai }` (+ optional
  `model`, `createdAt`). See `src/validation.ts`.
- A **collection** is a LanceDB table (think folder/project: `chatgpt`,
  `work_2026`). Table names starting with `__` are internal — `__threads`
  stores normalized turns per `(collection, sourceFile, conversationKey)` so
  thread view and `/api/files` survive moved/rewritten/deleted source files.
- A **thread** is the full source conversation reconstructed around a search
  hit — served from `__threads` first, falling back to re-parsing the source
  file for collections indexed before threads storage existed.
- A **ThreadShelf-created chat** is also normalized into turns, but is stored in
  the protected `threadshelf_conversations` collection with
  `createdInThreadShelf: true`. It has no fake export file. Completed exchanges
  and imported-thread continuations are persisted by `src/generation/threads.ts`
  and only their ThreadShelf-authored chunks are refreshed in semantic search.
- Supported providers live in `src/parser.ts` (`detectProvider`): `google-ai-studio`,
  `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `lm-studio`, `grok`. Adding a provider = add a detector + a
  `build…Conversations` function + a fixture + tests.

## Privacy & git hygiene (important)

- **Never commit real chat exports, `.lancedb/`, `.uploads/`, `.collections.json`,
  `.threadshelf/`, logs, or anything under `DO_NOT_COMMIT/`, `private/`, `exports/`.** These are
  already in `.gitignore` — do not weaken those rules.
- `.gitignore` ignores `*.json` by default and re-allows specific files
  (`package.json`, fixtures, configs). When you add a JSON file that _should_ be
  tracked, add a matching `!` allow-rule.
- Test fixtures in `test/fixtures/` are **synthetic and anonymized**. If a real
  export breaks parsing, reproduce it with a tiny anonymized fixture of the same
  shape — never paste real content.
- Before a public push, verify the intended release branch contains only public
  files and run `npm run check:repo`; never assume `.gitignore` can protect data
  that was already added to a commit.

## Testing

Three layers, all runnable offline:

1. **Unit / logic** — `test/*.test.js` (node:test via tsx). Fast, deterministic,
   no server. Parser, chunking, validation, etc. Run with `npm test`.
2. **API + MCP E2E** — `test/e2e/*.test.js`. `startApiServer` (in
   `test/e2e/helpers.js`) spawns a real `src/server.ts` on a random port with an
   **isolated temp LanceDB + uploads dir**, then drives it over HTTP
   (`ingestViaNdjson`, `/api/search`, …). The MCP test spawns the stdio server.
   Run with `npm run test:e2e`.
3. **Browser E2E** — `test/playwright/*.spec.js` + `test/playwright/fixtures.js`.
   Each worker boots a server (serving the built UI from `public/`) with isolated
   storage, ingests the bundled fixtures into a `pw_fixture` collection, then
   tests the real UI (search, thread reader, role filters). Run with
   `npm run test:playwright`. **Requires** `npm run build:client` first and
   `npx playwright install chromium`.

### Rules for E2E

- Never point E2E at a user's real LanceDB/uploads — always use the temp dirs the
  helpers create. They are removed on teardown. Any script that spawns
  `src/server.ts` must also set `COLLECTIONS_PATH` (the manual-collections
  registry defaults to `.collections.json` in the cwd and would otherwise be
  shared across servers and polluted with test collections).
- `test/shared/helpers.js` builds the "mixed folder" from `test/fixtures/*.json`
  (one subfolder per provider). E2E and Playwright import that helper, so add new
  provider fixtures there once.
- UI selectors are stable IDs/classes (`#searchInput`, `#collection-<name>`,
  `.result`, `#threadOverlay`, `#threadContent`). Prefer those over text matches.
- Embeddings run locally; the first E2E run downloads the model and is slow.
  Subsequent runs are cached.

### Adding a provider (checklist)

1. Detector + `build…Conversations` in `src/parser.ts` (+ `parse<Provider>` export
   and a `Provider` union entry).
2. Anonymized snapshot fixture in `test/fixtures/`.
3. Case in `test/fixtures.test.js` and a `detectProvider` assertion in
   `test/parser-more.test.js`.
4. Add the fixture to the mixed folder provider list in `test/shared/helpers.js`.
5. Add UI provider metadata in `client/src/constants.ts`, provider color tokens
   in `client/src/styles/_tokens.scss`, and IndexingView support copy.
6. Document it in `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (incl. a "tested on version X, format not
   guaranteed" note for undocumented formats — AI Studio, OpenRouter, LM Studio).

## Known gaps (as of this writing)

- Real-data, per-provider validation is still being built out (see
  `docs/REAL_DATA_TESTING.md`). Fixtures are synthetic snapshots, not full
  coverage of every export quirk.
- Undocumented formats (Google AI Studio, OpenRouter, LM Studio) have no schema
  contract; a vendor update can break parsing. Keep version notes in README.

When you finish a task, update this file if you changed commands, layout, or
conventions.

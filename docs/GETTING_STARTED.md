# Getting Started

This guide gets ThreadShelf running locally and indexes your first export folder. It assumes you want a private local search tool, not a hosted service.

The optional llama.cpp/OpenRouter conversation continuation is an
**Experimental Alpha**. Search remains local; OpenRouter continuation is external
and is selected through the clearly marked **OpenRouter · external** provider.
See [GENERATION_ALPHA.md](GENERATION_ALPHA.md).

## 1. Install

Requirements:

- Node.js 20.19 or newer.
- npm.

Install dependencies (one `npm install` covers the server and the client via npm
workspaces) and build the web UI:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:client
```

## 2. Start The App

```bash
npm start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Use a custom port if needed:

```bash
npm start -- 3001
```

## 3. Create Or Select A Collection

A collection is a separate local search index. Think of it like a project folder inside the vector database.

Use one collection per archive or provider when testing:

- `ai_studio`
- `chatgpt`
- `claude`
- `openrouter`
- `work_archive`
- `personal_archive`

The special `All` option searches across indexed collections.

Recommended workflow:

1. Start with a throwaway collection.
2. Index a small sample.
3. Search and inspect a few threads.
4. Only then index a larger real archive.

This makes parser issues easier to debug and prevents accidental destructive operations on your main archive.

## 4. Index Exports

Use either path:

- Folder picker: best for normal use.
- Manual folder path: useful when browser folder access is awkward or when indexing very large local folders.

Supported inputs are JSON exports from:

- Google AI Studio (the Drive "Google AI Studio" folder; files may have no extension).
- OpenAI / ChatGPT.
- Anthropic / Claude.
- OpenRouter JSON created by this project's browser-console export script.
- LM Studio (`.lmstudio/conversations/*.conversation.json`).
- Grok / xAI (`prod-grok-backend.json` from an account export).

The app skips known account metadata files such as `users.json`, `projects.json`, and `message_feedback.json`.

An active run has a **Stop indexing** action. Cancellation propagates to the
server and embedding loop. A batch already being embedded finishes before the
operation stops so ThreadShelf does not replace a previously healthy file with
partial index data; files completed earlier in the run remain indexed.

## Folder Picker Versus Manual Path

Folder picker:

- Easier for normal browser use.
- Uploads selected files into `.uploads/`.
- Good when you do not want to paste local paths.

Manual path:

- The server reads files directly from disk.
- Better for very large folders.
- Useful when browser folder upload is slow or awkward.
- Requires the path to be readable by the Node.js process.

## Clear First

`Clear collection first` removes existing indexed vectors from the selected collection before indexing. It does not delete the original export folder from your disk.

Use it when:

- Reindexing the same folder.
- Rebuilding a collection after parser changes.
- Avoiding duplicate chunks.

Do not use it on a collection you care about unless you are ready to rebuild it.

Deleting a collection removes its index and any copies uploaded through the
browser folder picker. Files in the original folder on your computer are not
deleted. Manual-path indexing never moves or deletes the original files.

## 5. Search

Search by meaning, not only exact text. Useful query types:

- A phrase you remember from a conversation.
- A topic summary.
- A code/API name.
- A multilingual term.

Use role filters to search only:

- User prompts.
- Thinking/reasoning fields when present.
- Assistant responses.

## Exact Search Versus Semantic Search

ThreadShelf is primarily semantic. That means a query can find related text even when wording differs. This is useful for old conversations where you remember the topic but not the exact phrase.

For rare IDs, exact filenames, package names, or short symbols, switch to
**Exact** mode for case-insensitive substring matching.

## Role Filters

Role filters answer different questions:

- User only: "What did I ask?"
- Assistant only: "What answer did I get?"
- Thinking only: "What reasoning traces exist in exports that include thinking?"

If search looks empty, check role filters first.

## 6. Open Threads

Search results are chunks. A chunk is only the part of a conversation that matched the query.

Click a result to open the routed thread reader. Current indexes load normalized
turns from the internal thread store, so a conversation remains readable after
its source export is moved, rewritten, or deleted. Older indexes may still fall
back to the original source path until they are re-indexed.

Use thread view to verify:

- Result context.
- Conversation order.
- Whether the match came from user prompt, thinking, or assistant response.
- Whether model metadata looks plausible.

## 7. Local Data Folders

Runtime data is local:

- `.lancedb/` - vector database.
- `.uploads/` - uploaded source files.
- `.collections.json` - remembered manual collections.
- `.threadshelf/generation.json` - non-secret Experimental Alpha generation settings.
- `.tmp-*` - test temp folders.
- `test-results/` - Playwright artifacts.

These should not be committed.

## 8. Useful Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:playwright
npm run check
npm run parse -- path/to/export.json
npm run mcp
npm run setup:llama                  # local discovery only
npm run setup:llama -- -- --check    # release metadata only; no archive download
```

If Playwright browsers are not installed:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Troubleshooting

If first ingest is slow, the local embedding model may be downloading or loading.

If search returns nothing, check:

- The selected collection.
- Collection stats: files and chunks should be above zero.
- Role filters: you may have filtered out the role that contains the match.
- Parser support: unsupported export shapes need a tiny anonymized fixture and a parser test.

If upload fails, try:

- A smaller folder.
- A path without unusual nesting.
- Manual folder path ingest.
- Checking that `.uploads/` is writable.

If OpenRouter export looks incomplete:

- Reopen the OpenRouter chat.
- Scroll to load the full history.
- Run the browser-console export script again.
- Parse the downloaded JSON with `npm run parse -- file.json`.

If real provider exports fail:

- Do not commit the real file.
- Create a tiny anonymized fixture with the same JSON shape.
- Add a failing parser test.
- Fix the parser.

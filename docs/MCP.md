# MCP Setup

ThreadShelf includes a stdio MCP server so local AI tools can query indexed conversations.

MCP is useful when you want Cursor, Claude Desktop, or another MCP-aware client to search your local AI chat archive without manually opening the web UI.

## What MCP Uses

The MCP server does not create a separate index. It reads the same local data as the web app:

- LanceDB path from `LANCEDB_PATH`, default `.lancedb`.
- Uploaded/source files from paths stored during ingest.
- The same collections created by the UI/API.

Index data first with the web UI or API. Then connect an MCP client.

The stdio server defaults to MCP protocol `2024-11-05` for broad Claude Desktop
compatibility, and negotiates `2025-03-26` or `2025-06-18` when a client requests
one of those versions during `initialize`.

## Start Manually

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run mcp
```

The server communicates over stdio. It is not an HTTP server and should not be opened in a browser.

## Client Command

Most MCP clients need:

```bash
npm run mcp
```

Set the working directory to the repository root.

If your database lives somewhere else, pass environment variables in the MCP client config:

```json
{
  "LANCEDB_PATH": "D:\\threadshelf\\.lancedb",
  "UPLOADS_DIR": "D:\\threadshelf\\.uploads"
}
```

Use your real local paths.

## Example MCP Config Shape

Different clients use slightly different config files, but the shape usually looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "threadshelf": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "C:\\Users\\you\\path\\to\\threadshelf",
      "env": {
        "LANCEDB_PATH": "C:\\Users\\you\\path\\to\\threadshelf\\.lancedb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a client does not support `cwd`, use an absolute repository path and run `tsx mcp/server.ts`.

## Tools

Current tools:

`list_collections`

- Lists local LanceDB collections.
- Use first to understand what can be searched.

`list_files`

- Arguments: `collection`.
- Lists indexed source files in one collection or across `all`.
- `collection` defaults to `all`.
- Useful before asking for a full thread.

`get_stats`

- Optional argument: `collection`.
- Returns the same stats as `/api/collections/all/stats` or
  `/api/collections/:name/stats`.
- `collection` defaults to `all`.
- Useful before broad searches so agents can see whether anything is indexed.

`search`

- Required argument: `query`.
- Optional arguments: `collection`, `n`, `roles`, `mode`, `keywordBoost`, `model`, `from`, `to`.
- Returns ranked snippets with source metadata.
- `collection` defaults to `all`; pass a collection name to narrow the search.
- `roles` can include `user`, `thinking`, and `ai`.
- `mode` is `semantic` (default, embedding similarity) or `keyword` (exact
  case-insensitive substring match — use for identifiers, error strings, code).
- `model` performs a case-insensitive substring filter.
- `from` and `to` accept ISO timestamps or `YYYY-MM-DD` date bounds.

Example arguments:

```json
{
  "query": "where did I discuss OpenRouter export automation?",
  "collection": "all",
  "n": 10,
  "roles": ["user", "ai"],
  "keywordBoost": true,
  "from": "2026-01-01"
}
```

`read_thread`

- Arguments: `sourceFile`, optional `collection` and `conversationKey`.
- Loads and parses the full source conversation.
- `collection` defaults to `all`.
- Pass the `conversationKey` returned by `search` when one export file contains
  multiple conversations.
- Use after `search` returns a promising source file.

## Resources

The server also declares resource templates:

- `threadshelf://collections`
- `threadshelf://collections/{collection}/files`
- `threadshelf://thread?path={absolutePath}`

Tools are usually easier for agents. Resources are useful for clients that expose MCP resources directly.

## Recommended Agent Workflow

Ask the MCP client to:

1. Call `list_collections`.
2. Call `get_stats` to check indexed volume.
3. Call `search` with `collection: "all"` or a specific collection.
4. Inspect returned snippets and metadata.
5. Call `read_thread` only for the most relevant result.
6. Use the full thread as context.

This avoids dumping huge conversations into context unnecessarily.

## Manual Verification

After configuring an MCP client:

- List collections.
- Search a known query in a real test collection.
- Retrieve one thread.
- Confirm the response contains source file, collection, role, turn index, and useful snippet text.

You can also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

The E2E suite includes a stdio MCP smoke test.

## Safety

MCP exposes your local indexed chat archive to the connected client. Only connect clients you trust.

Practical safety rules:

- Do not index archives you do not want the MCP client to access.
- Prefer separate collections for sensitive projects.
- Use `collection`-scoped searches when possible.
- Do not expose the local app or MCP process to untrusted users.
